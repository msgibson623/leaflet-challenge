Marcus Gibson's Module #15

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, I've been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

I started by visualizing my earthquake data. I pulled the data from the site and formated the data in JSON format. From there I Created my map object and added tile layers. I pulled the data from the link that was provided. I created a function with a series of statements to test depth range with color labels. I then read in the data from the link and use the GeoJson function to draw the map. I add my circle markers with the repective label colors. Lastly, I add my legend with the coreect information.
